You really have to be outstanding to get noticed and even then, it is not overwhelming. The pay is just average, and the raises are very small.

The problem is, they are expected to work like dogs, so often times they are struggling just to get what they need to do, so don't expect much training from them.

If you work a position like this at AT&T, be prepared to deal with the immense amount of stress that comes along with it. Poor methodologies, unrealistic deadlines, and an uncooperative IT department take the normal stresses of software engineering and architecture to a whole new level.", "num_helpful": "0", "advice": "Take advantage of software such as EasyCRM to streamline your business and take some of the development and capital load off of the backs of your employees who have more important problems to address then simply compensating for lack of technology.", "rt_work_life": "2.0"}

They step up and offer a competitive wage and provide paid, basic technical training at their training facility in Nashville. You get to learn the basics of working with low voltage, twisted copper pairs and serving terminals. If you make it through pass/fail training tests, you will get to keep your job and enter the field in job shadow training with a senior tech. If the senior tech recommends you a good fit and you make the cut, you will get your own van assigned and mostly new tools to work with. Most days, you work autonomously, unless you fall below the metrics and number goals upper management setup. This where the rest of the job becomes all Cons...", "rt_mgmt": "2.0", "rt_comp": "3.0", "comp_name": "AT&T", "rt_total": "2.0", "rt_values": "1.0", "date": "2017-07-22", "con": "First and foremost, AT&T is no longer your grandparents good ole phone company. It is an international, outsourced money-hungry empire, led by greedy corporate management in TX. The company will tell you that they care about the customer. Don't be fooled. This company only cares about making money and as a Wire Tech, you are the grunt at the bottom of this corporate food chain. AT&T has moved away from providing quality phone and internet services to a strange entertainment and television company. Customers are just as confused now as the entire tech teams across the country. On this job, you are nothing more than a number on the metric system, closely monitored everyday by management. If you manager makes good numbers based on his tech's numbers, he gets a pretax bonus and you get nothing. Let me explain. This job is all about numbers and metrics. You will have more metrics and stats to strive for than a sports team or any other job in the world. These are the metric columns you have to maintain: Efficiency, Dispatch Efficiency, Quality, AIQ, Time not dispatched, Drive time, how many jacks you installed, how many AT&T apps you installed on customer's devices, how many pair changes you can do (which makes no sense), how many hours you demanded (actually worked) vs. how many hours the system calculates you earned...the list goes on and on. You are like an ant under a hot sun magnifying glass everyday. If you do not exceed the unrealistic numbers, your manager will begin to put you on his radar and micro manage every job and situation your in. He will assign jobs close your local garage, so he can roll up and heckle you about things such a not having rubber gloves on while using needle nose pliers or not putting a safety cone against the driver side of the customers car door. If a manager does not like you and you fail to make his pretax bonus, he can manipulate the system and get you fired. In addition to the very stressful pressure of trying to achieve your numbers everyday, the job in general will drain the life out of you. Prepare to become an AT&T zombie. On your days off, you will be so physically and mentally exhausted, it will be hard to get motivated to leave your house. This job will grind on you and cause a stress reverb to hang over you, even on your off days. Most techs all have a daily fear of losing their jobs. The management has made this position maintain an impending doom vibe. It takes daily mind renewal and focus to overcome the piles of nonsense you have to dig through. Let me give you one working example. If you get a big install job and spend 7 hours at the site, doing all the right things for the customer and ensuring the faulty AT&T lines and equipment works but the company only allows you a ridiculous 3 hours to complete this job, you have just entered the \"red\". All of your numbers are now negatively effected and you will take a strike against your performance metrics. On this same job..say a bad storm comes through and blows out the customer's new AT&T RG (modem) and that customer calls 800 number, you will get a 0-5day repeat. Your manager will come and inspect your job and regardless of what happened, you will get wrote up for it and the document goes in your personal record. Additionally, you now will drop in your quality metric, which is the \"golden\" metric that holds your job in place. By the way, managers can manually lower the quality metric to keep you lower than the goal, in order to heckle you more. Most weeks, the workflow are techs trying to do their best job, while dealing with mental warfare the management keeps launching at the techs. If you have children and value a good quality life at home or with friends, this job is not for you. I have a daughter and only see her 30 minutes before bed. Then on my contract weekend, I have to spend half of the first day off resting just to get back in the family and home state of mind. Trust me, this job has so much turn over and is easily replaced. Don't be enticed with the $20+ hr they promote. You are doing the work of 2-3 people all by yourself. This job is geared for a young, single person that might want to begin some basic technical skills and save up some cash for a couple of years. There's no future in this job or company. AT&T outsources as much as possible to the Dominican Republic and India. The company is buying out and doing everything to appear as though their dominating Xfinity and Charter but they're not. The company can only provide poor DSL internet speeds, faulty fiber optics not reaching GB power as thought, and now remounting satellite dishes with expensive, hyped up commercials paying Mark Waulburn to say what they want. It's all a money hustle and you will be at rock bottom, taking the blame for the poor services that do not work. When I arrive to a repair job the first thing I ask is \"have you had trouble before?\" 8 out of 10 customers will tell you that their service always cuts in and out. If you're ready to be micromanaged, do the work of 3 people all alone, work in mostly dirty houses, be treated like a number and chase your tail trying to make AT&T bad services and equipment work then this is your gig.", "num_helpful": "1", "advice": "Be a caring coach and not a dirty roach.

In over 15 years in accounting and finance, this is the first organization that has required me to work on all major holidays. Work/life balance means we will allow you to recoup your time later, but family and friends are rarely able to wait for a week or two until you can recoup your time to take off and celebrate with them. Almost everyone in the Global Ops Center in downtown Cincinnati is new. This means that very few people really have a solid framework of information about the organization in order to make informed decisions or to inform others in their decisions. I quickly learned to not take other people at their word as most are quick to give the impression that their opinion is correct without considering that the siloed nature of information within this organization makes it nearly impossible for any one person to fundamentally know anything about which they speak if it isn't in reference to their microscopically specific responsibilities. The workspace is touted as a collaborative environment, and yet it does not lend itself well to collaboration among team members without finding a meeting space. Alternatively, there is not privacy or quiet space for thinking unless you grab a phone room. Perhaps workspaces within each group would allow for more active huddling. Functions within the same business are spread out over several different floors and spaces, where having everyone sit together in the same space would make more logical sense from a collaboration standpoint. Departments and functions feel very disjointed. \"Change is the only constant\" is a favorite phrase around the office, but the momentum of change that is occurring doesn't allow for people to adapt and become experts at anything before moving on to the next shiny system or tool meant to \"streamline\" processes...that no one has even had an opportunity to establish in the first place. \"Not your grandpa's GE\" is also another favorite phrase. While I admire progress and innovation, perhaps taking some notes from Grandpa's GE with regards to structure, guidelines and foundational organizational processes would have been beneficial instead of sending Grandpa to the nursing home and essentially writing him off. Bigger is not always better. They lure applicants in with attractive salaries only for them to find out that 60+ work weeks are the norm and the salary isn't that lucrative at all, once you do the math.

Also, be up front with people when you interview them and let them know your work expectations. The general \"are you OK with overtime\" seems a bit misleading as anyone who has worked in accounting/finance knows that OT is fairly standard at period/quarter close and will answer yes.

Right now, employee production is tracked by how often your butt is in your seat not by how effective you are at doing your job. I suspect this is the main reason there are no telecommute options. That is a culture change that needs to happen. Costco is big on keeping everything the same - meaning that warehouse workers can't telecommute so IS shouldn't either. That way of thinking is going to have to change if Costco is going to continue to fend off Amazon.

Boeing is very much stuck in a seniority system. Most personnel decision making (pay, assignments, promotions, etc.) is dominated by years of service requirements. This creates a company where people either learn to \"do their time\" and lose their passion or they leave the company. Many talented young people are coming to the company, getting frustrated with this culture and leaving. Facilities/offices are generally pretty crappy and drab, and parking is a nightmare at the major sites. There seems to be an expectation in the Puget Sound that regardless of where you live you will eventually have to commute to a different site, regardless of how much this may impact your life or family. Despite this, senior management seems to be completely uninterested in investing in any kindof inter-site transportation, or even building enough parking spots for employees to reasonably get to work. I have honestly spent over an hour, multiple times trying to find a place to park when coming to Renton site or Everett site mid-day for a meeting. Its an incredible waste of time and frustrating.

PLAN on being in the top 2 on your team or you'll never get anywhere however. PLAN on your bathroom breaks and time being mirco-managed to the hilt. PLAN on physically being tied to your desk. Lots of backstabbing. So if you still want this......Stay out of politics, keep your nose down and mind your own business, do not use - I repeat DO NOT use common sense or what is sometimes best for the customer but stick to the word track word for word or you WILL FAIL. This company is great to have for your insurer - one of the best, but to work for......depends on who you are.

{"comp_id": "3012", "loc": "Cincinnati, OH", "rt_opp": "3.0", "review_id": "Flag_EMPLOYER_REVIEW_15719232", "pro": "Benefits are truly unbeatable, honestly. After 1 year of working there you receive full benefits: dental, vision, prescription, and no deductible. I have mine through Anthem Blue Cross/Blue Shield. After 1 year you get 2 weeks paid vacation and paid holidays. After 2 years you get 3 weeks paid vacation and it keeps going up after a certain amount of years are worked. I work with a guy who's been there for 23 years and gets 7 weeks paid vacation every year! It's awesome. It's also honest hard work and if you're not a sissy it provides a certain amount of satisfaction when the job is done for the day. You'll start out as a loader or unloader (unloading is easier). I was an unloader for a month before they promoted me to a sorter. You'll start out at $10.15 as a loader or an unloader and a sorter makes a dollar more. You also get 2 raises a year. One in February and one in August. I went from $10.15 to $12.00 in just a year and a half. If you're looking to make GOOD money, then you'll have to become a driver or work in full time management. Driver's are full time and start out at $18.75 an hour and I think full time management starts out at $60k a year but they're both seniority based jobs. Staying with the company for many years is crucial to making the big bucks. If you go into management though then you'll lose Union benefits which I hear are better than management benefits. I worked in the Cincinnati Hub by the way. Different locations might pay slightly differently, obviously. As far as management to worker relationships goes it depends on location. If you work hard then management shows a high amount of respect and will most likely give you a little bit more hours a week and also could help you climb the ladder of promotion a bit easier (even though it's mainly seniority based). You'll be working around 20-25 hours a week on average. During peak season (November 25th-January 1st), however, you can work as much as you want because they'll be needing help during the holidays. I worked 71 hours in one week and around 60 the other 4 weeks so definitely take advantage of those peak hours. The time and a half and double time rack up big time during peak. My personal advice would be to WORK HARD and IT WILL pay off. Another helpful tip to the \"out of shape people like me\" when I started is that you will definitely lose weight. I went from 225 at 6'1 to 195 in 3 months. No kidding! It's labor work. What do you expect? Oh and they also offer in-school tuition help. I think it's $2,750 in help every semester! Not too shabby! You'll work for a good company and also get free money to help aid in getting a degree wherever you go! My advice would be to take advantage of that. Go to work, go to college, graduate, become a driver and make $60k+ a year or go into full time management with that degree you received and make $60k+ a year.

Super hard work and if you don't want to be a driver or work in management then it takes forever to make decent money. It is hard work but like I said if you're not a wuss ball then you'll be fine. Also, try not to shoot for working on IC's/Irregs/Gold belt if you can help it. That's the easiest place to throw out your back or pull/tear something bc of obvious huge weight increases in packages. If you never become a driver or go into full time management then it'll take at LEAST 15 years of employment before you make decent money.

Too often, I have been reprimanded for procedures and policies that I was never trained on -- even to the extent of formal written warnings. Also, on countless occasions, I have asked for instruction and received three different answers from three diffierent coaches/ supervisors.

Not only is there no consistency in training, but there is favortism that clouds management. Several times I have seen the top selling consultants break rules to make their numbers and management simply looks the other way. Unless you are willing to brown nose management or bully callers into buying coverage that they don't understand and is overpriced beyond budget, you will not succeed at Progressive. They pretend that you have the opportunity to own your call, but they prevent consultants from transferring callers to the agent that they request. This is not a company that provides job security.

IF they are sleep deprived, how is that helping run things smoothly. No wonder there has been so much bad publicity about airlines, dragging people off of planes, yanking strollers and forcing them off of planes. Any one who hasn't had sufficient rest is bound to act a fool---not in their right minds. The ones that get it the worst are the \"Newbies\", the less seniority the more chance you'll get the shift from \"Crazy Town\". If they're new, then they're LEARNING the job, and how can anyone be expected to learn and be the most efficient being sleep deprived. Oh and expect to work for days on end before you get a day off since they call you in on your day off to come and work. Career opportunities are good if you have time to go for them, since your working for \"Crazy Town\" airline shift, good luck. How does HR not keep an eye on these crazy type shifts is beyond me. Isn't it a liability if folks are sleep deprived and can make mistakes? IF they are sleep deprived and make mistakes, do they get fired or do they cut them slack?

It's a hard pill to swallow having not gone job hunting through several rounds of layoffs and a year where leadership admitted the made some mistakes. If they are willing to cut benefits every few years, along with people, approach cautiously. They just targeted staff with 4-20 years of experience and you may be next. Yes I was blessed to have a pension at all, but that is the compensation we agreed to. And yes, I have time to change plans and save more, but I would have preferred a no raise year for everyone instead of just us experienced staff having to put more away.

With business declining quarter after quarter with no end in sight, the morale is low. There's quite of bit of micromanagers that someone continue to get promoted. You can expect a list of to-dos with bullet points and meetings before the meetings to \"align\" and \"gut check\" and \"check-in\".", "num_helpful": "5", "advice": "Create a true Finance Leadership Development Program or change the name to Finance Rotation Program. Limit the number of Finance Development Leaders instead of having 95% of the Finance department in the program. Quit promoting micromanagers. It's discouraging to the analysts when they see it happen. Get rid of the bad managers that have grown up in General Mills culture from undergrad and knowingly make analyst lives miserable. Yes, their experts on the floor, but is it really worth them driving the analysts crazy with their non value added asks?", "rt_work_life": "5.0"}

There seems to be a disproportionate number of white males that talk loud about their own personal politics, this includes some senior managers. They sort of remind me of those guys that took over that federal building in the park. In any other companies that behavior would not be tolerated. There are trainers that will also do this which is totally nuts. This is for training where people outside of the company pay for the training! Some employees will also do this as well as making racist comments at employee functions. I hope HR and the CEO reviews this because on a scale from 1-10 it is a 10 for being a problem. Now with that said, I would estimate that this behavior is exhibited in a very small percentage of the white males, most are very professional, but the percentage is much greater than I have seen anywhere else, and it only takes a few bad apples ... Actually I have never seen this behavior anywhere else at any other company I have worked at. With the changing demographics of the US nothing good is going to come of it. I think given the extent of the problem HR needs to communicate to managers that if this behavior is observed and brought to their attention, the manager must contact HR or face disciplinary action. In other words if the employee eventually complains to HR and if it is clear the employee also brought it to their managers attention(which might not be any easy thing to know with certainty), and HR finds the manager never brought it to their attention, the manager faces disciplinary action. The urgency of this being addressed requires drastic action. I think that is the only way the problem can be crushed. It should be communicated to managers that can't sit on doing nothing even if the behavior is coming from another group. Like it or not, the US demographics is changing, which means adjust or become obsolete from no longer being able to attract as much top talent as the other guy and hence going OUT of BUSINESS or being bought out.", "rt_work_life": "5.0"}

One day, I overheard a top manager implying a promise to give two other interns a full-time spot on the team one day, and soon after that my time was up. I got along well enough with the manager in question, but I didn't make the manager laugh like the other two agents.
